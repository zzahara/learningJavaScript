helloworld:

My first experience with JavaScript was writing a hello world program.

ex1:

The first JavaScript exercise from http://www.nvcc.edu/home/wpegram/Javascript/javascript_exercises.html. ex1.html loads the JavaScript from the ex1.js file.

loadtime:

Experimented with some JavaScript that measures the load time of a page (found online http://www.techlists.org/archives/web/javascript/2005-07/msg00169.shtml).

Firebug:

Implemented the load time code in the Firebug homepage. I compared the calculated time with the time given by Firebug.
